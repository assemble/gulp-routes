```js
var routes = require('gulp-routes');
var Router = require('en-route').Router;
var router = new Router();

// define middleware
router.all(/\.hbs/, function (file, next) {
  var str = file.contents.toString();
  // do anything to `file` that can be done
  // in a gulp plugin
  file.contents = new Buffer(str);
  next();
});

// pass the router to `gulp-routes`
var route = routes(router);

gulp.src('*.hbs')
  .pipe(route())
  .pipe(gulp.dest('_gh_pages/'));
```

### [route](index.js#L66)

Create a router stream to run middleware for the specified method.
